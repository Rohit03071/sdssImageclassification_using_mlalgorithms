You are seeing a project Idea which has been explored by my friend's and I recently. 
We have always been enthusiastic about everything astronomy ðŸ˜Š, basically all related to astonomical phenomena, space, dark matter everything.

So we had this idea of making a software to classify all the galaxies we see in the known universe ofcourse those which have the information available on the internet and have a really good dataset including the images we need and fall into diiferent different classes which is being done by the scientists since ages, we just want to make the whole process automate. 

We want to make the classification process more time and cost efficient and at the same time as performative as human classification with bare eyes and with years of their knowledge in this field.
